"""
This example shows how to use the manual controls plugin.

Note: Manual inputs are taken from a test set in this example to decrease complexity. Manual inputs
can be received from devices such as a joystick using third-party python extensions

Note: Taking off the drone is not necessary before enabling manual inputs. It is acceptable to send
positive throttle input to leave the ground. Takeoff is used in this example to decrease complexity

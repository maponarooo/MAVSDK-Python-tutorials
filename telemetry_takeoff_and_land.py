    This is the "main" function.
    It first creates the drone object and initializes it.

    Then it registers tasks to be run in parallel (one can think of them as
    threads):
        - print_altitude: print the altitude
        - print_flight_mode: print the flight mode
        - observe_is_in_air: this monitors the flight mode and returns when the
                             drone has been in air and is back on the ground.

    Finally, it goes to the actual works: arm the drone, initiate a takeoff
    and finally land.

    Note that "observe_is_in_air" is not necessary, but it ensures that the
    script waits until the drone is actually landed, so that we receive
    feedback during the landing as well.
